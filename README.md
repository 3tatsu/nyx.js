Welcome to the `@nyxjs/source` monorepo! This repository is the central hub for all Nyx.js packages and tools,
designed to empower developers with a high-performance, modular TypeScript ecosystem for building next-generation
Discord bots.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

The monorepo is organized into various packages, each fulfilling a critical role in the overall architecture of Nyx.js.

#### ‚úÖ Currently Under Development

- `core`: The fundamental component of Nyx.js, providing the essential elements that power the rest of the system.
- `gateway`: Handles WebSocket connections and shard management for efficient communication with the Discord API.
- `logger`: Advanced logging system for application tracking and debugging.
- `nyxjs`: The main package that connects all components and serves as the entry point for Nyx.js.
- `rest`: Manages REST API requests to Discord, with rate limiting and caching strategies.

#### ‚è≥ Future Development

- `create`: A CLI tool for easily generating new Nyx.js projects, including templates and configurations.
- `database`: A unified database manager supporting multiple database engines.
- `panel`: An administrative panel built with Next.js to monitor statistics (guilds, members, commands).
- `plugins`: A set of optional plugins to extend Nyx.js functionality.
- `store`: Optimized in-memory data and cache management system.
- `voice`: Enables voice connections and interactions, allowing bots to join voice channels.

#### üí≠ Proposed Future Packages

- `i18n`: Internationalization and localization system.
- `testing`: Tools and utilities for automated testing.
