# TODO: Refactor Benchmark System

The current benchmark system needs to be completely reworked, as it does not resemble a proper benchmark at all. Here
are the tasks to address:

- Redesign the benchmark methodology to ensure accurate performance measurement.
- Implement reliable metrics for comparison.
- Ensure the benchmark covers all relevant aspects of the system.
- Document the new benchmark process clearly.
- Validate the results to ensure they are consistent and meaningful.

The goal is to have a benchmark that provides actionable insights into the performance of our system.

## Benchmark Libraries

- `nyx.js`
- `discord.js`
- `eris.js`
- `oceanic.js`
