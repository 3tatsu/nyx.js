# Discord Libraries Benchmark Implementation
This project aims to establish a comprehensive benchmark system to compare the performance of major Discord libraries. The goal is to obtain accurate and comparable measurements between the different available options.

## Benchmark Objectives 
- Measure raw performance (response time, memory usage, CPU)
- Evaluate high load handling (stress testing) 
- Analyze long-term stability
- Compare resource consumption
- Document results with detailed graphics and metrics

## Libraries to Test
- `nyx.js`
- `discord.js`
- `eris.js`
- `oceanic.js`
- `aoi.js`

## Key Metrics
- Average event response time
- Memory usage under different loads
- Messages processed per second
- WebSocket connection stability 
- CPU impact based on number of guilds

## Expected Outcomes
The results of this benchmark will allow developers to choose the library best suited to their needs based on concrete and measurable data. Each library will be tested under identical conditions to ensure fair comparison.

## Implementation Timeline
1. Setup testing environment
2. Develop benchmark scripts
3. Run initial tests
4. Analyze results
5. Create comprehensive report
6. Publish findings

The documentation will include detailed performance graphs, resource usage statistics, and specific recommendations based on different use cases.
